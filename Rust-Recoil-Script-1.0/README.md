## Warning

* Use At Your Own Risk
  - Using this on EAC may result in a ban
  - Only randomization is within the smoothing

## For Personal Use
* Fov is best at 90
  - Best sense is 0.5
* Dont Use Overlay
  - Its a top most and unnecessary
  - Remove start_overlay() inside run() under #Startup Functions
* No need to setup the Loader
  - This was built for fun and to send to some friends
* Best to Change these lines with some more randomization

I am using PHPmyadmin setup on Cpanel

Next you will need your DB info

I decided to encrypt all of my connection strings before hand using cryptography.fernet

To encrypt all of your connection strings folow this for each of what you want encrypted

Otherwise remove the encryption from mysql.connector.connect(EVERYTHING IN HERE) and replace with unencrypted info

Once encrypted put them into there respective spots in Loader.py mysql.connector.connect(IN HERE)
